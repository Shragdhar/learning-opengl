This is a OpenGL 2D game/physics engine made purely as an excuse to learn advanced C++ and graphics programming.
#### Currently Working On: Making a Triangle
## Planned Features:
- Cellular Automata
- Terrain Generation
- Basic Newton's Laws

These are more of a motivation to continue making the engine than absolute features that would be added.
